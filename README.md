Using python to code some basic machine learning algorithm

Hi guys! I'm a beginner and interested in machine learning and AI. The python ML package Scikit-learn is quite handy and very friendly for newbie like me. People can simply import ML models to predict things and know nothing about the underlying mathematical stuff. However the mathematical foundations of ML is important and difficult, I was most been pushed away at beginning. Luckily I found Professor Rebecca Willett's course of Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning on the web. This course was fantastic and super friendly to beginners and life-long learners! I was motivated to code those machine learning algorithm by the knowledge I'v learnt from the course. Step by step, we shall conqure these mathematical monsters!
